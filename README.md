# stat_cast_experiments

This project details my experimnetation with real stat cast data from MLB player Aaron Judge. I used Code Academy to import the data, and did 3 projects. I calculated Aaron Judge's strike zone based on the calls that umpires make on him, and drew a boundary around the zone with an SVM. I also, wrote code to display the location and pitch type of all pitches that were called strikes on Judge and all pitches that resulted in an expected batting average above .300 (calculated by exit velocity and launch angle).
